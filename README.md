## Finishing Remarks & Thoughts

A simple app, nothing too amazing. This project took me about 4 hours to make
and about 2 hours to debug.

It was my first time using "useEffect" hooks, and this project helped me
greatly in understanding them (and better know the "useState" hook)

## Features & Improvements

* __API__ : Calls an API for images and pokemon names
